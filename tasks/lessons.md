# Lessons Learned

## Kinetic Modeling
- **Concentration Scaling**: Always standardize units (e.g., ppb) across the entire pipeline. Mixing molar ratios, ppm, and ppb causes detection thresholds to fail and scoring to zero out.
- **Boolean Guarding**: When calculating ratios (like lysine budget or masking factors), always guard against zero-sum denominators (`if sum > 0: ... else: 0.0`).
- **Detection Thresholds**: In scientific benchmarking, ensure that safety scoring and off-flavor detection use sufficiently sensitive thresholds (e.g., 1e-20 ppb) to capture the effects of barrier-shifting interventions (like calcium carbonate) even at high temperatures where formation is rapid.

## Architecture & Data Structures
- **Dataclass Defaults**: Adding required fields to shared dataclasses like `FormulationResult` breaks existing unit tests that use positional arguments or incomplete mocks. Always provide sensible defaults for new fields.
- **Redundant Scaling**: Avoid "stacking" Boltzmann factors. If the recommendation engine already accounts for kinetic probability in its concentrations, the scoring layer should use them directly rather than re-applying the exponential.
- **SMILES vs Common Names**: Scientific benchmarks and sensory modules often use fuzzy name matching. Using common names as keys in `predicted_ppb` dictionaries is often more robust than raw SMILES, provided the pipeline's canonicalizer (e.g., `_canon`) handles non-SMILES strings gracefully (by returning the original string with a warning).

## Sensory Modeling
- **Unit Propagation**: Psychophysical models (Stevens' Law) are extremely sensitive to input units. A 1000x error (ppm vs ppb) can drop concentrations below the odor detection threshold (ODT), causing `KeyError` or zero scores.
- **Mocking Robustness**: When mocking databases for sensory tests, ensure all internal maps (`smiles_map`, `chemical_to_descriptor`) are populated consistently with the implementation's lookup strategy.
- **Intervention Transparency**: Ensure that high-level evaluation methods (like `evaluate_single`) correctly propagate all formulation attributes (especially `interventions`) to the underlying evaluation loops, otherwise the resulting scores will lack scientific sensitivity.
## Rule-Based Engines
- **Label Robustness**: Exact label matching for chemicals (e.g., "leucine" vs. "l-leucine") can cause silent failures in rule-based engines. Always normalize labels to a canonical, case-insensitive form before dictionary lookups to ensure all intended pathways fire correctly.
